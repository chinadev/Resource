Install Storage node packages:

# apt-get install swift-account swift-container swift-object xfsprogs

# yum install openstack-swift-account openstack-swift-container openstack-swift-object xfsprogs

For every device on the node you wish to use for storage, setup the XFS volume (/dev/sdb is used as an example). Use a single partition per drive. For example, in a server with 12 disks you may use one or two disks for the operating system which should not be touched in this step. The other 10 or 11 disks should be partitioned with a single partition, then formatted in XFS.

# fdisk /dev/sdb

mkfs.xfs -i size=1024 /dev/sdb1
echo "/dev/sdb1 /srv/node/sdb1 xfs noatime,nodiratime,nobarrier,logbufs=8 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
mkdir -p /srv/node/sdb1
mount /srv/node/sdb1
chown -R swift:swift /srv/node

Create /etc/rsyncd.conf:

uid = swift
gid = swift
log file = /var/log/rsyncd.log
pid file = /var/run/rsyncd.pid
address = <STORAGE_LOCAL_NET_IP>

[account]
max connections = 2
path = /srv/node/
read only = false
lock file = /var/lock/account.lock

[container]
max connections = 2
path = /srv/node/
read only = false
lock file = /var/lock/container.lock

[object]
max connections = 2
path = /srv/node/
read only = false
lock file = /var/lock/object.lock         

Edit the following line in /etc/default/rsync:

RSYNC_ENABLE = true

Start rsync daemon:

# service rsync start

[Note]	Note

The rsync daemon requires no authentication, so it should be run on a local, private network.

Create the swift recon cache directory and set its permissions.

# mkdir -p /var/swift/recon
# chown -R swift:swift /var/swift/recon
